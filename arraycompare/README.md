# Array Comparison Challenge
Write a function that takes two collections of strings as input, and reports on the difference of these two lists.  It should report what is unique to set A, what is unique to set B, what is in common to both.  All from one function call.

## Simon's notes
My code examples are fairly basic. There are a number of items I did not consider:
- One or more empty array
- Duplicated entries in the arrays
- Performance on very large arrays (I believe the functional approach I've used is elegant but not optimal in terms of performance...)
